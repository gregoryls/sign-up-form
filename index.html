            <p>The view of the earth from the moon fascinated me - a 
                small disk, 240,000 miles away. It was hard to think 
                that that little thing held so many problems, so many 
                frustrations. Raging nationalistic interests, famines, 
                wars, pestilence don't show from that distance. I'm 
                convinced that some wayward stranger in a space-craft, 
                coming from some other part of the heavens, could look at 
                earth and never know that it was inhabited at all. But 
                the same wayward stranger would certainly know instinctively 
                that if the earth were inhabited, then the destinies of all 
                who lived on it must inevitably be interwoven and joined. 
                We are one hunk of ground, water, air, clouds, floating around 
                in space. From out there it really is 'one world'.</p>
